Hey, welcome to my website ðŸ‘‹

Hello everyone! I'm Alexandru Andrei Colacel, a graduate in Computer Science from [Sapienza UniversitÃ  di Roma](https://www.uniroma1.it/it) , currently employed at Lutech since 2023.

Since I was young, I've had a passion for computer science, spending hours in front of the screen in my grandparents' room. This interest led me to attend a technical high school, where I delved into the basics of computer science and got in touch with programming languages like MySQL and C.

During my academic journey, I studied a wide range of subjects, from mathematical foundations to automata theory, from software engineering to computer architecture. I always sought to integrate theory with practice, acquiring concrete skills in software development and algorithm implementation.

My thesis focused on developing a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), exploring its applications in IoT and utilizing technologies such as Solidity, Go, and Docker.

I am enthusiastic about using my knowledge and skills to contribute to your organization's success and projects.
