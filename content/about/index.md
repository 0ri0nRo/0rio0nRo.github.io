Hey, welcome to my website ðŸ‘‹

I'm Colacel Alexandru Andrei, a Computer Science student at [Sapienza UniversitÃ  di Roma](https://www.uniroma1.it/it). I am a passionate computer science enthusiast with a strong academic background in Algebra, Algorithms, Architectures, Automata, Computer Networks, Operating Systems, as well as applied mathematics courses such as Differential and Integral Calculus.

I have gained experience in designing and developing computer solutions through group projects and have demonstrated the ability to work in multidisciplinary teams. I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow professionally, and I keep my skills up-to-date by attending conferences and seminars.

I have a good knowledge of programming techniques and data processing and have acquired skills in user interface design. I can use my mathematical knowledge to solve complex computer problems and apply my understanding of theoretical principles of computer science to practical solution design.

I am enthusiastic about using my knowledge and skills to contribute to your organization's success and projects.
